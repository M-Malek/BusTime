?Problem description:
data_collector_poznan.src.structure.collector.py -> returned data, e.g.:
{'id': None, 'trip_id': '184', 'route_id': '184', 'lat': None, 'lng': None,
'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 17, 19, 55, 51), 'seq': 7, 'delay': 47}
can be corrupted or be a mess
'trip_id': '184' -> 184 is a line number, not real trip id!
lat or lng == None? Where is this vehicle?
?Problem potential solution:
For trip_id changed that trip_id is always from vehicle file -> bullshit, loop takes trip_id as key argument!
trip_id is correct,
For None as lat or lng:
if seq is not None:
    set lat and lng as stop lat and lng based on timetable bus location (przypisz lat i lng dla przystanku na którym
    wg. sekwencji powinien być pojazd)
if seq, lat and lng is None:
    set lat, lng and seq based on timetable,
For all required correction mark entry as correction: true,

{'id': None, 'trip_id': '13', 'route_id': '13', 'lat': None, 'lng': None,
'timestamp': datetime.datetime(2025, 7, 17, 20, 47, 31), 'seq': 17, 'delay': 59}
Check if example like abow are not first or last stop of vehicle!

?Problem description:
ZTM is able to change current timetable while during its validity
?Problem potential solution: check timetable more than once per day - this solutions required to change settings in
zip_gather - currently zip_gather checks if file with schedules already exists, if not, new schedules is downloaded
2025-07-28 - download_trips_data in zip_gather.py has been modified and left as optional function, new simple function
schedules_downloader has been downloaded
New and old schedules should be saved in database. Storing old .zip can be resource-hungry (one .zip weight ca. 7 MB)
Old .zip as archive can be downloaded once and add as old route's path at a later date as feature (check old schedules
and routes)

?Problem description:
No Polish letters during .zip encoding!
?Problem potential solution: simple, change encoding.
?Problem final solution: Using Nodepad++ I read one of file. Notepad++ detected an ut-8-com encoding. I set encoding
for files as utf-8-sig. Everything works fine.

?Problem description:
zip_collector.py -> schedules_collector: function has bad optimization. It took more than an hour to take data (all
tests with test_one() in sip_collector_test.py has been aborted.
?Problem potential solutions: changing function with help of ChatGPT. Learned about code optimization.
?Problem final solution: Rewriting code, created ScheduleCollector class in zip_collector.py.
Able to prepared data on workdesk in 57 s.
It's necessary to check work of ScheduleCollector class on low-spec device like Raspberry Pi Zero 2.
